		<article>
			<p>
				I've recently started working from home, and it's... different.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I was born  in the country of Dominica.  No, not the Dominican republic.  My family didn't have much money but we made due with what we did have... 
				A house and farm land.  My mom worked very hard to send my siblings and me to school.  Eventually we moved to the United States Virgin Islands where i grew up. 
				I've seen my mom struggle, and through it all, she still found a way to push us to be the best that we can be.
