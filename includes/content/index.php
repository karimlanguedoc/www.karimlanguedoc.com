		<p>
			I am an extremely passionate and talented software engineer with a passion for developing easy to use applications with beautifully designed 
			UI that people just can’t wait to get their hands on.  My work ethic is through the roof, and i’m sure you’ll agree if you met me. I believe 
			the future is mobile and I believe in mobile first development. I love developing for iOS and I love developing products that millions of 
			people are going to see and use. It gives me a great sense of pride and motivates me to always create quality work.

			I’ve worked closely with some amazing engineers on very tough, custom projects that have not only ranked high in the App Store but have been 
			featured by Apple as well. Learning is something that I love to do, and i never turn down a challenge. I truly believe that one of the reasons 
			people are successful in their roles is because of their coworkers, and the people around them that constantly push them to do better.
